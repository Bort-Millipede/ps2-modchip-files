Brought to you by SniperKilla
-----------------------------

Well, i woke up today, looked outside and thought it would be a great day to release the magic 2 code, so here it is folks, the code for V5 and V7 Magic 2's.

This is not for the average joe with a pic programmer. You need to program these onto Xilinx 9572 and Scenix 28 chips, and no gerber files will be included, make your own.

P.S.: Whats up Z over at ps2ownz.com, this releases is dedicated to you  as a big FUCK YOU, keep on playing with your swap discs and flip top covers, silly faggot.
