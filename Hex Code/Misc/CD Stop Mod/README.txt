CD spin down mod chip for EA back-up game swop
		
Once you hold in the RESET button until the EA swap point
and then let go it takes about 15 seconds to automatically
stop the spinning CD before the tray will pop-out for you!
Then just do the EA swap as you normally would and the CD
tray will automatically go back in about 4 seconds later.
